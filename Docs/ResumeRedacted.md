## Summary  
I'm an experienced and constantly growing C#, DevOps, Cloud and Game Developer.

## About me
- My career started as C# Game Developer using Unity Game Engine in 2018.
- I then learned to build Cloud services using C# and Azure.
- I became experienced in every aspect of the Cloud systems Development, including Architecture, DevOps, Frontend and Testing.
- I constantly try to learn and improve, which allowed me to quickly adapt and work on many projects using a variety of technologies.
- I am organized, eager to learn, open for new challenges and self-sufficient which resulted in beeing assigned into the most demanding tasks.

## Experience
### 0. Hobby
- I started learning programming at an age of 15 with Unity Game Engine and C# as my hobby.

### 1. C# .Net Developer
**Icebreaker Interactive**
<br>*Nov 2018 - Mar 2020 (1 year 5 months)*
- In 2018 I started working on my own game that I have designed.
- Game was founded by an publishing company Icebreaker Interactive (which no longer exists).





### 2. C# .Net Developer
**[Laparo Medical Simulators](https://www.linkedin.com/company/laparo-simulators/)**
<br>*Dec 2019 - Dec 2021 (2 years)*
- In 2019 I joined a startup named Laparo, developing VR Simulators for Surgeons.
- I was working there as an Unity Game Engine developer with C# but I quickly started to work on many other projects such as QA Process which I desinged and implemented.
- During that time I came up with an idea and designed a new product for the company which was a Web based App with online courses for Surgeons.
- I was assigned as a sole developer to this project, which forced me to learn Web Development from start to finish, including Architecture, Cloud design, CI/CD, Testing and Frontend.
- Working on that project I learnt Azure, Serverless, Asp.Net, GitHub, GitHub Actions, TypeScript and React.

### 3. Senior C# .Net Developer
**[Maandag IT Poland](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maandag-poland/)**
<br>*Dec 2021 - Present (2 years 6 months)*
- In 2021 I joined Maandag which is an recruiting firm, as a C# backend engineer with Azure as Cloud provider.
- Even though my experience was mostly in GameDev I quickly became a valuable team member and was assigned as a sole developer to design and create an automated Onboarding/Offboarding system for internal users of the company.
- This forced me to learn how to design, develop and deploy such complicated systems from start to finish. 
- I have designed an Event Driven system using Azure ServiceBus, Azure Functions, Azure Active Directory (now EntraId), OAuth, SendGrid, and other technologies. System was scalable, easy to maintain, and because of using events each process could be retried if failed.
- I introduced best DevOps practicies such as InfrastructureAsCode with Terraform, and ConfigurationAsCode with Azure AppConfiguration and KeyVault, which weren't used in the company before. Everything was automated using CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- I then used the gained experience to create an automated Terraform deployment system for other services of the company which untill then were setup manually. 
This resulted in reduction of creation time for new environments from 3 weeks of manual work into 2 hours of an automated pipeline run.
- I also used the experience gained creating a Event Based systems to refactor and redesign all of our backend services, which made them more stable and scalable as well as easier to maintain.
- In January 2024 I got promoted to a Senior Engineer role.
- I designed and implemented a new architecture for our systems which is based on Modular Monolith Architecture and is used since then.
- I started experimenting Microservices Architecture, using Kubernetes and Azure Container Apps to make our apps even more scalable.

## Projects
I use my experience to create Open-Source projects, tools, libraries and frameworks to help developers quickly deal with problems that I have already solved.
- [**Definit**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/Definit) helps with Configuration, Errors, Validation, etc.
- [**CodeOps**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/CodeOps) aims to move as much DevOps work from yamls etc. into C#.
- [**FeatureSlice**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/FeatureSlice) helps with using Vertical/Feature Slices Architecture.
- [**FluentServiceBus**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/FluentServiceBus) creates an easy to use API for Azure ServiceBus.
- [**Momolith**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/Momolith) helps to implement Modular Monolith Architecture.
- [**Config-Validator**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/config-validator) is a CLI tool to help Validate your configuration using an automated pipeline.
