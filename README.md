## About me
- My career started as C# Game Developer using Unity Game Engine in 2018.
- I then learned to build Cloud services using C# and Azure.
- I became experienced in every aspect of the cloud systems development, including Architecture, DevOps, Frontend and Testing.
- I constantly try to learn and improve my skills which allowed me to quickly adapt and work on different projects with different technologies.
- I am organized and self-sufficient which resulted in beeing assigned into the most demanding tasks.
- I put my experience into Open-Source projects and libraries to help other developers quickly deal with problems that I have already solved.

## Experience
### 0. Hobby
- I started learning programming at an age of 15 with Unity Game Engine and C# as my hobby.

### 1. Icebreaker Interactive
- In 2018 my first job became a game project that I designed and created which was founded by an publishing company Icebreaker Interactive.

### 2. Laparo
- In 2019 I joined a startup Laparo developing VR Simulators for Surgeons.
- I was working there as an Unity Game Engine developer with C# but I quickly started to work on many other projects such as QA Process which I desinged and implemented.
- During that time I came up with an idea and designed a new product for that company which was a Web based App with online courses for Surgeons.
- I was assigned as a sole developer to this project, which forced me to learn Web Development from start to finish, including Architecture, Cloud design, CI/CD, Testing, and even frontend.
- I learnt Azure, Serverless, Asp.Net, GitHub with Actions and React working on that project.

### 3. Maandag
- In 2021 I joined Maandag which is an recruiting firm as a C# backend engineer with Azure.
- Even though my experience was mostly in GameDev I quickly become a valuable team member and was assigned as a sole developer to design and create an automated Onboarding/Offboarding system for the company.
- This forced me to learn how to design develop and deploy such complicated systems from start to finish. 
- I have designed an Event Based system using Azure ServiceBus, Azure Functions, Azure Active Directory (now EntraId), SendGrid, and other technologies which was scalable, easy to maintain, and because of using events each process could be retried if failed.
- I introduced best DevOps practicies such as InfrastructureAsCode with Terraform, and ConfigurationAsCode with Azure AppConfiguration and KeyVault, which weren't used in the company before, everything was automatically deployed using CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- I then used experience gained during this process to create an automated Terraform deployment system for other services that our company used which were setup manually. 
This resulted in reduction of time for environments from 3 weeks of manuall work into 2 hours of an automated pipeline run.
