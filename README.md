### I'm an experienced but constantly growing C#, Cloud and DevOps engineer.

## About me
- My career started as C# Game Developer using Unity Game Engine in 2018.
- I then learned to build Cloud services using C# and Azure.
- I became experienced in every aspect of the cloud systems development, including Architecture, DevOps, Frontend and Testing.
- I constantly try to learn and improve my skills which allowed me to quickly adapt and work on different projects with different technologies.
- I am organized and self-sufficient which resulted in beeing assigned into the most demanding tasks.
- I put my experience into Open-Source projects, tools, libraries and frameworks to help other developers quickly deal with problems that I have already solved.

## Work Experience
### 0. Hobby
- I started learning programming at an age of 15 with Unity Game Engine and C# as my hobby.

### 1. Icebreaker Interactive
- In 2018 I started working on my own game that I have designed.
- Game was founded by an publishing company Icebreaker Interactive (which is no longer existing).

### 2. Laparo
- In 2019 I joined a startup Laparo developing VR Simulators for Surgeons.
- I was working there as an Unity Game Engine developer with C# but I quickly started to work on many other projects such as QA Process which I desinged and implemented.
- During that time I came up with an idea and designed a new product for that company which was a Web based App with online courses for Surgeons.
- I was assigned as a sole developer to this project, which forced me to learn Web Development from start to finish, including Architecture, Cloud design, CI/CD, Testing, and even frontend.
- I learnt Azure, Serverless, Asp.Net, GitHub with Actions and React working on that project.

### 3. Maandag
- In 2021 I joined Maandag which is an recruiting firm, as an C# backend engineer with Azure.
- Even though my experience was mostly in GameDev I quickly become a valuable team member and was assigned as a sole developer to design and create an automated Onboarding/Offboarding system for the company.
- This forced me to learn how to design, develop and deploy such complicated systems from start to finish. 
- I have designed an Event Based system using Azure ServiceBus, Azure Functions, Azure Active Directory (now EntraId), SendGrid, and other technologies which was scalable, easy to maintain, and because of using events each process could be retried if failed.
- I introduced best DevOps practicies such as InfrastructureAsCode with Terraform, and ConfigurationAsCode with Azure AppConfiguration and KeyVault, which weren't used in the company before, everything was automatically deployed using CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
- I then used the experience gained during this process to create an automated Terraform deployment system for other services inside company which untill then were setup manually. 
This resulted in reduction of creation time for new environments from 3 weeks of manual work into 2 hours of an automated pipeline run.
- I then used experience gained creating Event Based systems to refactor and redesign our other backend services, which made them more stable and scalable as well as easier to maintain.
- I designed and implemented a new architecture for our whole system which was based on Modular Monolith architecture which is used now inside company's backend services.

## Personal projects.
### Libraries/Tools/Frameworks
- I try to use my experience and create Open-Source libraries tools and frameworks.
- For now I focus moslty on C# with Cloud Native systems, I'm currently developing a framework called Momolith which allows for easier implementation of Modular Monolith Architecture.
- I have also created some stand alone libraries which aim to help solve common problems that I found.
- [**Definit**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/Definit) which helps with Configuration, Errors, Validation, etc.
- [**CodeOps**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/CodeOps) which are libraries aiming to move as much DevOps work from yamls etc. into C#.
- [**FeatureSlice**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/FeatureSlice) which is an library that helps with using Vertical/Feature Slices Architecture.
- [**FluentServiceBus**](https://github.com/HubiBoar/FluentServiceBus) which is an library that makes usage of AzureServiceBus simpler with an easy to use Fluent, LINQ like API.
